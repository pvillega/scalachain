# Understanding Blockchain - Preview


We are Kingsley Davies and Pere Villega and we are going to talk about Blockchain this coming Scala Exchange 2017!

Blockchain is the current hype in tech. Mainly thanks to Bitcoin, and its current ticker value, blockchain is a technology which interests many different organizations. We like following the hype wagon and we started learning more about blockchain. During this process we realised two things:

* many people have heard about blockchain but don't know what it really is
* at the point we started, there was little about blockchain in Scala, and it was hard to find.

This seemed a good opportunity for a talk at Scala Exchange about this subject, as it would solve both issues! We both started thinking about a talk independently but when the talk proposals were sent to Scala Exchange, it made sense for us to collaborate so we could give a better talk.

At the Scala Exchange, we are looking forward to meet again with members of the community from other countries that come to London every December to attend this conference. And, having seen the programme, we expect to leave the conference with plenty interesting ideas to explore.

If you want to learn more about blockchain, please come to our talk!
